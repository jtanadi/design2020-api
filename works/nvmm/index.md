The National Veterans Memorial and Museum—officially designated by the federal government as a national museum—honors veterans past and present who have served the nation and recognizes those who have answered the call of duty throughout America’s history. The Museum is the first dedicated to the veteran’s experience, and is a place to celebrate and honor the service and sacrifice of all veterans from the Revolutionary War to the present. Located on the Scioto Peninsula it is also a key part of the revival of downtown Columbus, Ohio.
