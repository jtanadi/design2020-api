The Draftery was a platform that promoted architectural drawings online and in print. The third issue of the printed journal, titled That then Disappear in the Building of It, revolved around parts of architectural drawings that are erased, forgotten, or become subsumed into the buildings they depicted.

To reflect this relationship, a strict color palette of black and red was used, echoing colors typically seen in architectural drawings. This color palette, along with the book’s typographic treatments, became part of The Draftery’s primary brand identity and were later expanded and extended to a range of printed materials in support of an exhibition in Watertown, Massachusetts.

With the launch of this issue, The Draftery’s website was redesigned from the ground up, employing a more robust CMS&nbsp;in order to include all of the information submitted by each&nbsp;drafter.

The Draftery was designed and edited with [Athan Geolas](http://cargocollective.com/ageolas/). Web development completed with [Greg Nemes](http://gregnemes.com/).
