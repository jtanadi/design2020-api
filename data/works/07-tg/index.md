Thomas Gardner is an architect and educator whose work revolves around notions of craft and architecture’s capacity as an agent of social change. The dual nature of Thomas’ practice was the starting point of the design of his application materials for MICA’s Center for Social Design.

The materials are divided into two books. The first holds written components: a letter of interest, statements on social design education, teaching philosophy, as well as a CV and references. This book is formatted like a trade book, featuring only text and sized to comfortably fit in one’s hands.

The second functions as a portfolio, employing two typographic grids to differentiate between Thomas’ professional work and his teaching portfolio. The focus on images is emphasized by the book’s large format.
