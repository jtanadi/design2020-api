Ditelan Asap is a printed specimen for an untitled typeface designed during Principles of Type Design at [Type@Cooper](http://coopertype.org/nyc). Because the typeface lacked uppercase letters, capitals from a second typeface, Theinhardt, were used as substitutes.

The content consists of a series of articles gathered associatively and loosely organized around topics of fire and smoke. Each section is designed with its own grid system and type treatments, allowing the typeface to beshown in a range of sizes and layouts.

Color images were tipped-in so that the book can be printed as cheaply as possible.
