*A Strange New Beauty* showcased Degas’ rarely-seen monotypes, a process that captivated him and expanded his drawing process. The book features two typographic grids: one for a longer introductory essay; another for shorter close readings that appear throughout.

While the layouts are straightforward and unembelished, the headers are allowed expression. Taking its primary cue from Degas’ inky and voluptuous marks, the headers are set in [Domaine Display](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/domaine-display/), a contemporary and curvaceous typeface.
