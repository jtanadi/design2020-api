Architecture lecture posters are typically designed to emphasize the names of visiting lecturers. The students, in turn, place these names at the top of the hierarchy of events, relegating all others as unimportant.

Using the trope of the calendar, the poster and mailer for RISD Architecture shifts the importance away from visiting lecturers and places them on the same level as other departmental events.

With printing budget as a major constraint, all materials were printed in either one or two colors. Fluorescent orange was used to tie all the elements together and as a way to grab the studentsâ€™ attention.
