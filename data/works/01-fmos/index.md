The Melab Gallery consists of five thematic zones: Connect, Relax, Move, Learn, and Eat. Each zone includes its own set of vertical “portals” that serve as an overview of that zone and a group of activity tables. The design team’s objective was to create a distinct identity for each zone while still maintaining a connection to the other four and to the gallery as a whole.

To address this challenge, we established a design strategy that uses distinct, but related colors and patterns, generated from the museum’s brand identity. In order to  achieve cohesion, a set of interchangeable components, graphic devices, and illustration and typographic kits-of-parts were developed to fit all five themes. This systematic approach allowed us to balance the need to maintain consistency while having enough freedom to create the more unique elements in the exhibit, such as interactive elements and games.
