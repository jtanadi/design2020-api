My name is Jesen Tanadi and I’m a designer and developer currently working on museums, design tools, and open source software. I’m currently working at Ralph Appelbaum Associates, where I have been involved with projects such as the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Holocaust Museum Houston, the National Veterans Memorial and Museum, the Royal Alberta Museum, and the Frost Museum of Science.

I have a background in architecture and graphic design, and experience working on complex design systems for a wide range of experiences as well as the necessary tooling to help designers achieve that goal. I’m always interested in hearing about any new designer/developer hybrid role. I'm fluent in Adobe CC, Figma, and JavaScript, and proficient in TypeScript and the JS/TS web stack (Node, express, React/Redux).
