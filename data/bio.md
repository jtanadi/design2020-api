My name is Jesen Tanadi and Iâ€™m a designer and developer currently working on museums, design tools, and open source software at [Ralph Appelbaum Associates](http://www.raany.com/). Over the years, I have been involved with projects such as the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Holocaust Museum Houston, the National Veterans Memorial and Museum, the Royal Alberta Museum, and the Frost Museum of Science.

I have a background in architecture and graphic design, and experience working on complex design systems for a wide range of experiences as well as the necessary tooling to help designers achieve that goal. I'm fluent in Adobe CC, Figma,and proficient in the modern JS/TS web stack (Node, express, React/Redux). If you'd like to chat about designer/developer hybrid roles, you can contact me through [e-mail](mailto:mail@jesentanadi.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jesentanadi), [GitHub](https://github.com/jtanadi), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesentanadi).

This website was written in TypeScript, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). The source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jtanadi/design2020).
