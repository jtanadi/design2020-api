My name is Jesen Tanadi and I’m a designer and developer currently working on museums, design tools, and open source software at [Ralph Appelbaum Associates](http://www.raany.com/). Over the years, I have been involved with projects such as the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Holocaust Museum Houston, the National Veterans Memorial and Museum, and the Frost Museum of Science.

I have a background in architecture and graphic design and experience establishing and managing complex design systems from conception to production for a wide range of experiences, as well as the necessary tooling to help designers achieve that goal. I'm fluent in Adobe CC, Figma,and proficient in the modern JS/TS web stack (Node, express, React/Redux).
